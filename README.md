# Description
StarGate-Customisations is an __*admin-facing*__ official module, providing admins with new options to customize [the Stargate plugin](sgrewritten.org/bukkitsource)'s feel and behaviour.<br>

## Features:
This is a work in progress: many features are [still being determined](https://github.com/stargate-rewritten/Stargate-Customizations/issues)

StarGate-Customizations consists of two parts (both of which may be toggled in whole or in part):
### Web GUIs.
- **A Gates Customisation Web UI**
  - This can include assigning specific gate types different animations.
- **A Sign Styles Customisation Web UI**
  - Per sign-material, gate-design, network, etc. hex colour schemes.
    - Includes specifying pointer colours, accents, etc.
  - Per sign-material, gate-design, network, etc. glowing/non-glowing toggle.
  - Per gate-flag colour overrides; can be adresseed at a per-sign-material level.
  - And much more.
### A `Tweaks` folder full with:
- An Animations Folder
  - A collection of style.yml files dictating such things as passive particle animations, activation/interaction animations, sound effects, etc.
  - These styles can be associated with gate files -- either directly or through the Gates Web UI.
- A colours.yml file
  - Some broad tweaks are specified here.
  - There is also a spot to specify a sign theme from the Web UI (made by anyone or made yourself).
  
## Dependencies
[The most recent version of Stargate](https://sgrewritten.org/download)

# Permissions
### Nodes
```
in theory:
sg.customizations.node.subnode

Having said that, this is an admin-facing config plugin;
so no in-game nodes should be needed.
```
### Defaults
see above.
